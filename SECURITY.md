# 🔐 Security Policy

## ✅ Security Matters — But Not Yet Fully Supported

We take security seriously and intend to establish a proper vulnerability reporting and patching process. However, as this project is still in active development and has **not yet reached v1.0**, we are **not accepting formal security reports** at this time.

## 📦 Supported Branches

| Branch      | Status                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| `develop`   | 🚧 Under Active Development |
| `main`      | ❌ Not Yet Supported        |
| `release/*` | ❌ Not Yet Supported        |

---

## 🚨 Future Reporting Process

After completing the [v1.0 roadmap](../../issues), we will:

- ✅ Open official security issue templates
- ✅ Define a clear reporting process
- ✅ Track and patch vulnerabilities on supported branches

**Thanks for your patience and interest in making this project more secure.** 🛡️
